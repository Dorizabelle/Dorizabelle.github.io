 It's a hot summer day. Or maybe a cold winter night... Honestly this drink is suitable for all season types. You start off with a strawberry acai. It's the basic refresher that we all know of. You don't stop there though, you continue to upgrade this drink. You need to reduce the ice because... Who likes a watery refresher? No one. THEN you need to take all that unnecessary water so you ask for no water, but instead replace the water with peach infusion. This adds a new foreign taste into the o.g. strawberry acai. 

 Starbucks order:
 Strawberry Acai
 No water
 Add peach infusion
 Light ice (or no ice so it can last a bit longer)
